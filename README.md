# SmartMatrix-LED-Display
This repository contains code for driving an LED matrix display using the SmartMatrix library. The display showcases a collection of images loaded from individual C files (a.c to z.c). The images are selected based on the analog input from a potentiometer. Each image is displayed on the LED matrix with accompanying LED lighting effects.
